Below is a real-time problem statement and JDBC CRUD project using a single table only — perfect for practicing simple JDBC operations.

---

    ✅ Project Title: Employee Record Management System

---

    📌 Problem Statement:

In many small organizations, maintaining employee records such as name, designation, salary, and department is often done manually or in spreadsheets. This can lead to data inconsistency and loss. A simple Java application is required to perform CRUD operations on a single table to store and manage employee records.

---

    🎯 Objective:

Build a console-based Java application using JDBC to manage employee records using a single table in a MySQL database.

---

    🗂️ Modules / Functional Requirements (CRUD):

1. Add New Employee

   * Input: Name, Department, Designation, Salary
   * Operation: Insert into the employee table

2. View Employee(s)

   * View all employees
   * View by employee ID

3. Update Employee

   * Update salary or designation of an employee by ID

4. Delete Employee

   * Delete record by employee ID

---

    🗄️ Database Table Design (MySQL):

   # `employee` Table

sql
CREATE TABLE employee (
  emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  department VARCHAR(50),
  designation VARCHAR(50),
  salary DOUBLE
);


---

    🧪 Sample Data:

sql
INSERT INTO employee (name, department, designation, salary)
VALUES 
('Rahul Kirpekar', 'Training', 'Senior Trainer', 65000),
('Shivani Patel', 'HR', 'HR Manager', 55000),
('Amit Shah', 'IT', 'Software Engineer', 60000);


---

    🛠️ Technology Stack:

* Language: Core Java
* Database: MySQL
* Connectivity: JDBC (using `Connection`, `Statement`, `PreparedStatement`, `ResultSet`)
* IDE: Eclipse / IntelliJ
* Build Tool: Not required for simple apps

    📦 Recommended Java Class Structure:


EmployeeCRUD/
├── DBConnection.java
├── Employee.java
├── EmployeeDAO.java
├── Main.java

    📘 Example Operations:

* Add: Insert employee “Ravi Kumar”, “Marketing”, “Executive”, `₹35000`
* View: List all or fetch employee with ID = 2
* Update: Change salary of ID 1 to `₹70000`
* Delete: Remove record with ID = 3
